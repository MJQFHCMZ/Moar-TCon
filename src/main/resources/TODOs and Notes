wispiron + steel -> Transisteel
Wispiron (Alk proc) -> Phasium A  B  Ω
Ionstone -? electricity eth layer
Elevantium -> valasium + ionstone composite
Terminite (alk) -> ??

Geodesium + Ebonite -> Voidlight (tr: nullglare -> attacks leave temp light sources that buff the attacker and team when in radius)

Alkinium - alchemical manipulation properties. good for refining other materials -> used for catalyzer
Refinium - the best way i can desc it is a racist metal lmao. essentially wants to stay pure. no alloys. used to make alk

vacuuite - maybe spawning in a lower rarer ethereal toplayer (bottomlayer :XD:)
terminium - end material. (same as vacuuite)

Ebonite + terminium + steel -> Gloomsteel
Gloomsteel + wispiron + (sponge) -> nullsteel

Anthracite - found on helltop

Ste'lantium - solsteel + metallic hydrogen catalyzer

Port in all F.W. metals. 

Bloodforged ? Thousands Droplets Rapier - "... of my Blood\nWhile holding this tool, you are surrounded by a swarm of your life force. Sneaking and swinging your tool launches a fraction of the swarm."
%something temp related ? Dual Certitude Cleaver  - "Yes i am 100% sure\nYour tool alternates between cold hits and hot hits. Cold hits freeze targets and makes them more vulnerable. Hot hits cause ignitions that deal massive damage. Kills with this weapon releases AOE explosions."

T1 -> vanilla tcon
T1.5 -> B.E. tools (opens roof and bedrock ores)
T2 -> Gravitonium sponges
T3 -> ethereal toplayer
T4 -> alkinium processing of lower tier ores to transmute them (alk proc)

taintsteel + thaumcraft support
